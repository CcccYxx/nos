# Developer

## Local development
We use [Makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com/) targets for making it easy to setup a local development environment.
You can list all the available targets by running `make help`.

### Create a local environment
You can create a local development environment just by running:

```shell
make cluster
```

The target uses [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to create a local Kubernetes cluster that uses Docker containers as nodes.


The nos operator uses webhooks that require SSL certificates. You can let cert-manager create and manage them by installing it on the cluster you have created in the previous step:
```shell
make install-cert-manager
```

### Build components
You can build the nos components by running the `docker-build-<component-name>` targets. The targets build the Docker images using the default image name tagged with the version defined in the first line of the Makefile.

Optionally, you can override the name and the tag of the Docker image by providing them as argument to the target.

#### Build GPU Partitioner
```shell
make docker-build-gpu-partitioner
```
```shell
make docker-build-gpu-partitioner GPU_PARTITIONER_IMG=custom-image:tag
```

#### Build Scheduler
```shell
make docker-build-scheduler
```
```shell
make docker-build-scheduler SCHEDULER_IMG=custom-image:tag
```

#### Build Operator
```shell
make docker-build-operator
```
```shell
make docker-build-operator OPERATOR_IMG=custom-image:tag
```

#### Build MIG Agent
```shell
make docker-build-mig-agent
```
```shell
make docker-build-mig-agent MIG_AGENT_IMG=custom-image:tag
```

#### Build GPU Agent
```shell
make docker-build-gpu-agent
```
```shell
make docker-build-gpu-agent GPU_AGENT_IMG=custom-image:tag
```

### Load Docker images into the cluster
> ⚠️ If you use the tag `latest` Kubernetes will always download the image from the registry,
> ignoring the image you loaded into the cluster.

You can load the Docker images you have built in the previous step into the cluster by running:
```shell
kind load docker-image <image-name>:<image-tag>
```

### Install components

You can install single nos components by running:
```shell
make deploy-<component>
````
where `<component>` is one of the following:
- `operator`
- `gpu-partitioner`
- `scheduler`
- `mig-agent`
- `gpu-agent`

The targets above installs the Docker images tagged with the version defined in the first line of the [Makefile](../../../../Makefile).

You can override the Docker image name and tag by providing it as an argument to the target:
```shell
make deploy-<component> <COMPONENT>_IMG=<your-image>
```
